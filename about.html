        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is chioma okereke, and I am a passionate frontend developer with a keen eye for design and
            usability. With 3 years of experience in the field, I specialize in creating responsive and user-friendly
            web applications that deliver an engaging experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am proficient in popular frameworks and
            libraries such as React, and Bootstrap. I enjoy collaborating with designers and backend developers
            to build cohesive and efficient solutions that meet user needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am constantly learning and keeping up with the latest trends in web development to enhance my skills and
            knowledge. When I'm not coding, you can find me experimenting with new technologies, contributing to
            open-source projects, or exploring creative design ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for visiting my portfolio! I look forward to connecting with you and discussing potential
            collaborations.
